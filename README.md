## Sending a Pull Request ?

This project encourage you to contribute through sending a pull request! There is a simple rule: please **don't** directly commit your contributions to the **master** branch. According to your commits, please choose the **hotfixes** branch or the **develop** branch. Thank you!

## Introduction to the Repository

There are two main branches with an infinite lifetime:
* **master** is the main branch and it is marked as every version release.
* **develop** is also another main branch where the source code reflects a state with the lastest delivered developement changes for the next release.

Other branches:
* **features** are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. Feature branches are named as 'feature-FEATURENAME'.
* **hotfix** is meant to prepare for a new release, and fixes some bugs from the corresponding tag on the master branch.
